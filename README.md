# Java_course

## Purpose of this repository

I'm on a journey: learn Java!

In this repository there are some basic exercises that show an initial learning process of the Java programming language
and OOP paradigm.

Here I'll be uploading exercises that I'm solving as I go through the course made by professor NÃ©lio Alves.
Link of the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/ (in PT-BR).

## The structre

Each folder is a section of the course.

Inside each folder there will be a README.md that contains the info about the exercises and what I learned.

Besides, my notes will also be inside the folder (if I've taken any).

## Remember

The codes are simple and perhaps not written in the best possible way due to my limited knowledge so far.

It's important to say that I intend to improve the codes posted, so I can upgrade them and see how I could do them in a
differente way, comparing each solution with a better version.
